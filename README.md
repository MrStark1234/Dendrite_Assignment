# Stark's Collaborative Whiteboard Project

Collaborative Whiteboard is a web application that allows users to collaboratively draw and share their ideas in real-time. The project utilizes technologies such as Keycloak for authentication, Socket.IO for real-time communication, React for the frontend, and Node.js with Express for the backend.

## Features

- **Authentication:** Secure authentication using Keycloak to ensure only authorized users can access the whiteboard.
- **Drawing Tools:** Provides various drawing tools such as pencil, line, and rectangle to create drawings with ease.
- **Download Drawings:** Users can download their drawings as PNG images for offline use or sharing.
